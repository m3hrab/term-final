	           an unordered array of floating point numbers.
	        2. Write a C program to find the total vowel count in a one-
	           dimensional array of characters.

	           element manually.
	        3. Accessing,adding,Update and delete Strings
	           using built-in string functions.
	           Strings built-in Functions:

	               7. strcmp()

	    Practice Problems:
	        1. Reading and storing characters in a character array and making that array a string.
	        2. Write a C program to find the total vowel count in a one-
	           dimensional array of characters.
	        3. Find the string length
	        4. Reverse the string 
        

3. Multidimensional Array (2D)

	    Theory:

	          without parameter/returnType 
	    
	    Practice-Problems:
	        1. Write a multifunctions program that calculate area of cirle/rectangle
	        2. Write a Userdefind functions to find the sum between to numbers.

5. Pointer
	
	    Theory:
	        1. Definitions with examples
