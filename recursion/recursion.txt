Definition:
    In programming, recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. This allows complex problems to be solved by dividing them into simpler and simpler subproblems until a base case is reached.

Example :
int factorial(int n) {
    // base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    // recursive case
    else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
