Definition:
An array in C is a collection of values of the same data type, stored in a contiguous block of memory. Each value in the array is identified by its index or position in the array, starting at 0.

For example, here's how you can declare an array of integers in C:
    
    int myArray[5] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };

This creates an array named numbers with five elements, each element containing an integer value. The elements can be accessed using their index, which starts from 0. For instance, numbers[0] refers to the first element, which is 1, and numbers[4] refers to the last element, which is 5.
